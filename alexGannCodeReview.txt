The code shows no visible errors, but when the program attempts to run, an exception is thrown saying, "System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: 'An attempt to attach an auto-named database for file F:\School\CodeProjects\assignment-3-build-an-application-MoltenSlag\AlexGann-CPT-206-Lab-2\bin\Debug\StateDatabase.mdf failed. A database with the same name exists, or specified file cannot be opened, or it is located on UNC share.'" Therefore the program cannot run, so looking at the code itself, repetitive code has been minimized, and there is no apparent dead code. Exception handling could be expanded for better coverage. Authors methods slightly differed from mine. The UI was slightly obnoxious in my opinion, the bright orange and green, with the crowded layout made it difficult to navigate and comprehend. Therefore, I would prefer an approach more comprehendable and less florescent. Overall, the author could improve code documentation, and consider expanding exception handling for better robustness.
